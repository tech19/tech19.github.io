- install packages:
php composer install
	-> install package in composer.json
	Q) composer.json location?  same level with vendor directory
	ex) monlog/monolog  -> dir  /vendor/monlog/monolog
	!! If you are using git for your project, you probably want to add vendor in your .gitignore. 
	!! You really don't want to add all of that code to your repository.

- Autoloading
	after that, Composer generates a vendor/autoload.php file
	require \_\_DIR\_\_ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
