### undo

* revert: remain in history, to target any one individual commit
*   checkout: HEAD no longer points to a branch—it points directly to a commit

    git checkout a1e8fb5\
    &#x20; Nothing you do in here will be saved in your repository

    git checkout master\
    &#x20; get back to the “current” state of your project
* reset: only work backward from the current commit
* clean: for undoing changes to the working directory

Once changes have been committed they are generally permanent Use git checkout to move around and review the commit history git revert is the best tool for undoing shared public changes git reset is best used for undoing local private changes

### commit

* amend commit: update current commit, not create new
* sign-off commit: add by who

### delete commit

If it is the last commit this is very straight forward. Simply run: git reset HEAD

*   rebase:  allow you to remove one or more consecutive commits

    `git rebase --onto` \~ \~&#x20;

    ex) git rebase --onto repair\~3 repair\~1 repair   &#x20;
* cherry-pick:  allows you to remove non consecutive commits.

```
init .
add
commit -am
log
```
